# Autism-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project explores the application of various supervised machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) based on behavioral and demographic data. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, model training, evaluation, and final prediction.

# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a robust model for early autism detection, using a structured ML pipeline. The steps include:

1. Data preprocessing (cleaning, encoding, handling missing values)
2. Exploratory data analysis and visualization
3. Feature selection and scaling
4. Model training with several classifiers
5. Model evaluation using AUC-ROC, cross-validation, and confusion matrices
6. Final model selection and testing with new input

# Dataset
Source: Autism Screening Data for Adults and Children (UCI Repository) [https://www.kaggle.com/code/shreyaporwall/autism-prediction/input]
Type: Behavioral screening responses and demographic attributes
Target: Binary classification (Autism risk or not)
